### __Site Structure__

Mr&Mrs Cleaners is a 5 page website. 
The home page is the default loading page, 3 pages are accessible from the navigation menu at all times and 1 page is only displayed on Contact Page Form submittion.  

### __Colour Scheme__

I used <img height="12" src="assets/other/colormind-logo.png"> [Colormind](http://colormind.io/bootstrap/) to find a perfect colour scheme that would tie-in with the nature of the business, be easily readable and visually appealing to users.

### __Typography__

The three fonts used were imported into the css from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
I used 'Dancing Script' for logo, 'Kanit' for all headings & 'Playfair Display' for any other text

![image](assets/other/google-font-dancing-script.png)

Sans-serif is the nominated fallback font

### __Imagery__

The images have been compressed in [compressor.io](https://compressor.io/) to enable faster loading times. 
The content images on Gallery Page are aligned in neat symmetrical grids for optimal viewing and user experience.
