### __Site Structure__

Mr&Mrs Cleaners is a 5 page website. 
The home page is the default loading page, 3 pages are accessible from the navigation menu at all times and 1 page is only displayed on Contact Page Form submittion.  

### __Colour Scheme__

I used <img height="12" src="/workspace/mr-and-mrs-cleaners/assets/other/colormind-logo.png"> [Colormind](http://colormind.io/bootstrap/) to find a perfect colour scheme that would tie-in with the nature of the business, be easily readable and visually appealing to users.

### __Typography__

The three fonts used were imported into the css from [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
I used 'Dancing Script' for logo, 'Kanit' for all headings & 'Playfair Display' for any other text

The content images on Gallery Page are aligned in neat symmetrical grids for optimal viewing and user experience.

## __Credits__

### __Code__

Throughout the building process I found many helpful tutorials online. 
I sometimes applied principles within them to the site, after fully understanding their code and modifying to fit the site's needs. 

- The service page was inspired by Code Institute's 'Love Running' project with some tweaks to adjust to fit Mr&Mrs Cleaners page and content
- The image gallery was inspired by Kevin Powell [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg7Fvvl3taU&t=1968s)

- Wireframes were made using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)
