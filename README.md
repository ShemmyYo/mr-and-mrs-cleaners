## __Project Goals__
This project has two main objectives: 
- To showcase web-technologies like HTML and CSS in compelling static front end application to present content to potential new customers
- To demonstrate my competency as a developer using HMTL & CSS languages

## __Brief__

After viewing business webpage of my friends [Mrs&Mr.Cleaner](http://mrsandmrcleaner.ie) I discovered that there is a huge potential to update their page to modern standards. 
I decided to take on this challenge and showcase my vision of their website.
Throughout the challenge I often watched tutorials and content online and in particular, I found it very interesting to watch YouTube channels of:
- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob)
- [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/c/WebDevSimplified)

## __UX User Experience__


### __User Stories__

As a user I want to be able to:

- Understand the character and purpose of the business
- Navigate through the site smoothly
- See examples of services provided
- View the business location and contact details
- Connect with the business on social media 
- be able to contact the company directly via form
- Learn more about the developer who created the site


### __Wireframes__
Before writing any HTML or CSS, I used Eagle to gather ideas and Balsamiq to create wireframes.

### __Site Structure__

Mr&Mrs Cleaners is a 5 page website. 


The home page is the default loading page, 3 pages are accessible from the navigation menu at all times and 1 page is only displayed on Contact Page Form submittion.  

### __Colour Scheme__

I used <img height="12" src="assets/other/colormind-logo.png"> [Colormind](http://colormind.io/bootstrap/) to find a perfect colour scheme that would tie-in with the nature of the business, be easily readable and visually appealing to users.

![image](https://github.com/ShemmyYo/mr-and-mrs-cleaners/blob/main/assets/other/color-scheme.png)

### __Typography__

The three fonts used were imported into the css from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)


I used 'Dancing Script' for logo, 'Kanit' for all headings & 'Playfair Display' for any other text

Sans-serif is the nominated fallback font

### __Imagery__

The images have been compressed in [compressor.io](https://compressor.io/) to enable faster loading times. 


The content images on Gallery Page are aligned in neat symmetrical grids for optimal viewing and user experience.

- Lighthouse feature in Google Chrome's Developer Tools

![image](https://github.com/ShemmyYo/mr-and-mrs-cleaners/blob/main/assets/other/lighthouse-validator-laptop.png) __results for laptop__

![image](https://github.com/ShemmyYo/mr-and-mrs-cleaners/blob/main/assets/other/lighthouse-validator.png) __results for mobile__


- Tests based on user stories:

    - __Navigate through the site smoothly__ - each page has been tested separately using HTML and CSS Validators as well as Lighthouse feature in Google's Dev Tool with a positive outcome and no major errors or warnings. The pages can be accessed in the same way on every page, via a very simply navigational menu, which highlights what page is active or hovered. Each link has been validated successfully.


    - __See examples of services provided__ - each page responsiveness has been tested manually using [Google Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/). The services page has detailed information on services provided and the gallery page extensive examples of successfully carried out previous jobs. Both pages' text and images collapse to 1 row on mobile and 2 rows, with no graphics in tablet view. Test positive and no bugs discovered.


    - __View the business location and contact details__ - each page has a Google map iframe to the bottom of the page and contact details. This was designed to stretch the map across in a mobile view and include contact details and a link (button) to a contact page which brings the user to the contact form on a contact page. A link has been validated and responsiveness tested positive with no errors.


    - __Connect with the business on social media__ - in addition, to tests carried out for business location maps and contact details, Social Media links have also been validated positive. Each link opens social media on a separate page - no errors have been found.   


    - __be able to contact the company directly via form__ - The contact form included on the contact page has been validated from a text type perspective as well as form shows a warning msg for all mandatory fields. No errors 





- Responsive tests were carried out manually using [Google Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/). The site loaded and ran smoothly on all devices and content adjusted as expected for each screen size.

Devices tested:
- min. width of 320px
- media breakpoint at 768px
- media breakpoint at 1200px
- Samsung Galaxy S8, S20 Ultra
- Iphone SE, XR, 12pro
- Pixel 5
- Ipad Air & Mini
- Surface pro 7 & duo
- Nest Hub & Hub Max



- Browser Compatibility

After publishing the site through Github pages, the site was tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari and Mozilla Firefox, with no visible issues for the user. 
The site has loaded perfectly and had no issues across all browsers.
